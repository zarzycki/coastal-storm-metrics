Zarzycki, C. M., Ullrich, P. A., and Reed, K. A. (2021). Metrics for evaluating tropical cyclones in climate data. *Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology*. doi: 10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0149.1. [Preprint PDF](https://colinzarzycki.com/papers/ZUR_metrics.pdf). [Supplemental PDF](https://colinzarzycki.com/papers/ZUR_metrics_SI.pdf).

This directory (the root) is defined as `${CYMEP}`. The released version of CyMeP is stored in `${CYMEP}/cymep/`.

### General workflow
1. Add TempestExtremes ASCII trajectories to ./traj/
2. Create a configuration .csv file in ./config-lists/
3. Edit user settings in cymep.py
4. Run cymep.py
5. Run graphics-cymep.sh

### 0. Install dependencies

The actual statistics package is all written in Python3 and requires several libraries. The easiest way to install relevant things is via `conda install`. `pip` or the full Anaconda package may also be an option. Required Python packages are:

```
sys
re
numpy
pandas
scipy
netCDF4
```

Also required for graphic generation (`graphics-cymep`) is NCL. NCL can either be installed from [source or binary](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/) or via [conda](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/conda.shtml). The latter is preferred.

### 1. Add trajectory files to ./traj/ folder.

Currently these files must be in "Tempest" ASCII format (a derivative of the old "GFDL" format, for those who understand what that means!):

```
start   31      1980    1       6       6
        482     303     120.500000      -14.250000      9.987638e+04    1.464815e+01    0.000000e+00    1980    1       6       6
        476     301     119.000000      -14.750000      9.981100e+04    1.398848e+01    0.000000e+00    1980    1       6       12
        476     300     119.000000      -15.000000      9.953694e+04    1.369575e+01    0.000000e+00    1980    1       6       18

        ...
```

where each trajectory has a header line beginning with `start` followed by the number of points in the trajectory (ex: 31) and the start date of the trajectory in YYYY MM DD HH.

Each subsequent line (31 lines) contains a point along the trajectory. Currently, this is hardcoded such that the columns are defined thusly:


| index | label | description  |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| 1 | ix | i-index (currently ignored)  |
| 2 | jx | j-index (currently ignored) |
| 3 | lon | longitude (degrees east)  |
| 4 | lat | longitude (degrees north)  |
| 5 | slp | sea level pressure (Pa)  |
| 6 | wind | wind speed (m/s) |
| 7 | phis | surface geopotential (m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>)  |
| 8 | yyyy | year integer |
| 9 | mm | month integer  |
| 10 | dd | day integer  |
| 11 | hh | hour integer (GMT)  |

There are two folders within the package that may be helpful:

1. An example of generating a TempestExtremes trajectory file from reanalysis is found in `${CYMEP}/tempest-tc/`. This script reads in MERRA2 data and generates a track file on NCAR Cheyenne.
2. Sample scripts for creating alternative formats can be found in `${CYMEP}/convert-traj/`. For example, one could use `ibtracs_to_tempest.ncl` to generate a text-based file compatibile with the software package from an IBTrACS NetCDF file.

### 2. Create a CSV file describing model configurations

Example for `rean_configs.csv`

```
ibtracs-1980-2019-GLOB.v4.txt,OBS,False,1,40,1.0
trajectories.txt.ERAI,ERAI,False,1,39,1.0
trajectories.txt.CR20,20CRv3,False,1,36,1.0
trajectories.txt.MERRA,MERRA,False,1,36,0.85
trajectories.txt.MERRA2,MERRA2,False,1,39,0.85
trajectories.txt.JRA,JRA,False,1,39,0.98
trajectories.txt.CFSR,CFSR,False,1,39,0.883
trajectories.txt.ERA5,ERA5,False,1,39,1.0
```

Using the first line as an example...

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ibtracs-1980-2019-GLOB.v4.txt | Trajectory file name in traj dir |
| OBS | "Shortname" used for plotting, data output |
| False | Is the traj file unstructured? (1-D column indices instead of 2-D) |
| 1 | Number of ensemble members included in trajectory file |
| 40 | Number of years per ensemble member in trajectory file |
| 1.0 | Wind speed correction factor |

**NOTE**: The first line will be defined as the reference, so this should *always* be either observations or some sort of model/configuration control.

**NOTE**: The wind speed correction factor is a multiplier on the "wind" variable in the trajectory file to normalized from lowest model level to some reference height (e.g., lowest model level to 10m winds for TCs).

### 3. Edit cymep.py

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| gridsize | Length of side of each square gridbox used for spatial analysis in degrees (e.g., 8.0) |
| basin | Set to negative to turn off filtering, otherwise specify particular ocean basin/hemisphere based on mask functions |
| csvfilename | The name of the file stored in `config_files` that contains the list of files to be analyzed |
| styr | Start year for overlapping interannual correlation analysis |
| enyr | End year for overlapping interannual correlation analysis |
| truncate_years | If `True` then filter out years external to styr and enyr. If `False` keep all data |
| do_defineMIbypres | Define maximum intensity location by PSL instead of wind? (default: False = wind) |
| do_fill_missing_pw | Fill missing data with observed pressure-wind curve? (False leaves data as missing) |
| do_special_filter_obs | Do we have special observational filtering? (if true, code modifications needed) |
| THRESHOLD_ACE_WIND | Select threshold wind (in m/s) for ACE calculations (negative value means no threshold) |
| THRESHOLD_PACE_PRES | Select threshold SLP (in hPa) for PACE calculations (negative value means no threshold) |

**NOTE**: if you have a non-TempestExtremes-TC configuration, you need to modify the array extraction found by grepping for `USER_MODIFY` in `cymep.py`.

### 4. Run cymep.py

Finally, run cymep.

```
$> python cymep.py
```

This will produce two sets of files. One, a handful of CSV files in `${CYMEP}/cymep/csv-files/`. Two, a NetCDF file in `${CYMEP}/cymep/netcdf-files/`.

NOTE: Eventually, the `csv-files` folder will become obsolete and all output from the suite will be packaged via NetCDF.

### 5. Run graphics-cymep.sh

```
$> ./graphics-cymep.sh netcdf-files/netcdf_GLOB_rean_configs.nc
```

This will produce a suite of figures in various subfolders within `./fig/`.


### Run with CMEC driver

An alternative workflow is available with [cmec-driver](https://github.com/cmecmetrics/cmec-driver) and conda. This workflow uses conda to manage python environments. Follow the cmec-driver [installation instructions](https://github.com/cmecmetrics/cmec-driver#cmec-driver) to install cmec-driver in a conda environment. Then use the following workflow:
1. Clone the coastal-storm-metrics repository.
2. Use conda to install dependencies in an environment called "_CMEC_cymep". This can be done using the provided yml file:   
`conda env create --file cymep.yml`
3. Register CyMeP in the cmec library:
`cmec-driver register <path to coastal-storm-metrics repo>`  
    - If you have not run cmec-driver before, you must also register your conda installation information:
    `cmec-driver setup --conda_source <conda source executable> --env_dir <conda env location>`  
    For a standard anaconda or miniconda installation, this might look like:  
    `cmec-driver setup --conda_source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh --env_dir ~/miniconda3/envs/`  
4. Create a "cmec-driver" folder *outside* of the coastal-storm-metrics repo. In the cmec-driver folder, create two subfolders: "model" and "output".
5. Add TempestExtremes ASCII trajectories to `cmec-driver/model`.
    - For testing, copy `cymep/trajs/*` to `cmec-driver/model`
6. Create configuration csv in cmec-driver/model.
    - For testing, copy `cymep/config-lists/rean_configs.csv` to `cmec-driver/model/rean_configs.csv`.
7. Edit user settings in cmec-driver/config/cmec.json.
    - For testing, use the default settings.
8. Run CyMeP module from the cmec-driver directory:
`cmec-driver run model/ output/ CyMeP`
9. Open `/output/CyMeP/index.html` to view results.
