write_cmec.py

This script generates figure information for the output.json file that
accompanies the module output. It also creates an html landing page that
links to the output figures and metrics JSONs.

This is run after the figures are generated in the CyMeP CMEC driver script.

The CMEC environment variables must be set to run this script successfully.
